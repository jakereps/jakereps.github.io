My name is Jorden Kreps and I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics, with a strong interest in Pattern Recognition. I am working as an Associate Data Scientist, with an emphasis in Bionformatics, at [Biota Technology][1] in San Diego, California. My previous position at [Pathogen and Microbiome Institute][2] (PMI) involved developing software for open source bioinformatics projects in the [Caporaso Lab][3], including [QIIME 2][4] and [scikit-bio][5].
