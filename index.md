My name is Jorden Kreps and I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics, with a strong interest in Pattern Recognition. I am working as a Data Scientist at [Biota Technology](http://biota.com/) in San Diego, California. My previous position at [Pathogen and Microbiome Institute](http://www.mggen.nau.edu/) (PMI) involved developing software for open source bioinformatics projects in the [Caporaso Lab](http://caporasolab.us/), including [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org/) and [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org/).
